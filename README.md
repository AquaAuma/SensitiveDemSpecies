# SensitiveDemSpecies
Extending the analysis on sensitive species developed by Rindorf et al., (accepted, Journal of Applied Ecology) Are fish sensitive to trawling recovering in the Northeast Atlantic? 

Analysis based on a population model (Gislason et al., 2008 https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsn035), a collection of traits, IUCN red list status (https://www.iucnredlist.org/), exploitation of demersal fish species (Walker et al., 2017 https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsw250), market values and abundances from European trawl surveys (https://datras.ices.dk/)
